# Manga Helper

> **Note:** Manga Helper is a Python script designed to convert CBZ files to PDF and compress PDFs. I developed this script in just a few hours as a small helper tool.

## Features

- **Convert CBZ to PDF**: Easily convert CBZ files into PDF format for better accessibility and readability.
- **Compress PDF Files**: Reduce the size of PDF files while maintaining quality to save disk space.
- **Create PDFs from Images**: Combine multiple images in a folder into a single PDF file.
- **Additional Utilities**: Includes functionalities for renaming files and etc

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries: `Pillow`, `PyMuPDF`

## Running the Script

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Required Libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install PyMuPDF Pillow
   ```
2. **Execute the Script**

   ```bash
   python path/to/your/script.py
   ```
3. **If you want to have Exe file**
   ```bash
   pip install -U pyinstaller
   ```

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile path/to/your/script.py
   ```

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Conversion Failures for Some CBZ Files**  
   Occasionally, certain CBZ files may fail to convert to PDF. This issue occurs with some rare CBZ files, and despite trying various methods to handle these cases, there isnâ€™t a reliable solution yet.

2. **Limited PDF Compression**  
   The current compression functionality for PDF files does not significantly reduce their size. The script focuses on maintaining the original quality of the PDFs, which means that the file size might not decrease as much as expected. Future updates may include improved compression algorithms for better size reduction without compromising quality.

3. **Missing PDF Merging Feature**  
   The script currently lacks a function to merge multiple PDF files into a single document, which could be useful for combining chapters into volumes. This feature is planned for future development, but it is not available at this time.

We appreciate your understanding regarding these limitations and are open to contributions or suggestions for improvement!
